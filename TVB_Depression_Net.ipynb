    "# Depression Network Modeling in TVB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we outline the project to develop a network model of the depression network directly modulated by SCCwm-DBS. This model will serve as the foundation for many projects, but the immediate goal is for it to be used in improving classification accurace in SCCwm-DBS confirmation.\n",

    "### First steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building the network model\n",
    "First, we build a network model using the standard connectivity (192 parcellation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing and forward modeling\n",
    "Next, we visualize the model in the context of the 256-channel EEG recording setup. Part of this is to develop a gain model for the forward modeled EEG from the brain activity.\n",
