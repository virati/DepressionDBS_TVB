# TVB Depression DBS Networks

The goal of this project is to develop a set of network models that can be used in a flexible way for a variety of data, modeling, and mathematical projects.


## Structure


### Scripts
We'll have a set of scripts that implement various dynamical network models through the TVB

* Kuramoto Model
* Jansen-Rit Model
* LEGACY: Wilson-Cowan Model
* Generic Hopf


### Model Library
Aspirationally, we also want to provide a library that wraps TVB models with an interface that immediately enables control-theoretic frameworks and analysis.
